### Castle Animations (from CastlesGroup.tsx)
```typescript
- Rotation: 0.003 rad/frame + index offset
- Bobbing: sin(time * 2) * 0.3 vertical
- Sway: sin(time) * 0.05 rotation
```

### Cloud Animations
```typescript
- Horizontal: sin(time * 0.15 + index) * 0.018 * layerSpeed
- Vertical: sin(time * 0.25 + index) * 0.01
- Rotation: 0.0008 rad/frame
```

### Particle Movement
```typescript
- Velocity: Random XYZ between -0.025 to +0.025
- Upward bias: +0.015 to +0.04 on Y axis
- Reset at height: 45 units
```

### Light Pulsing
```typescript
- Purple: 1.6 ± 0.4 (sin(time * 2.2))
- Blue: 1.6 ± 0.4 (cos(time * 2.7))
- Orange: 1.3 ± 0.3 (sin(time * 2))
```
